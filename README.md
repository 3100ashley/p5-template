# p5-template

Use this template for a brand new p5.js project. 


# Assignment 1: Make a brush
- Find an object, texture, or motion that you want to recreate using p5.js Here is [some inspiration](https://lmccart.github.io/p5-workshop/). 
- Include one element that changes as you move the mouse (aka make a “brush” you can "draw" with using the mouse)
- Include one element that is different each time you load the sketch (you may want to use randomness!)
